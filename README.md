### Typescript Fork

I started this project as I wanted to use this theme in my next project but TypeScript is my first concern. Customizing Material-UI and modularizing overrides can be a headache due to type issues.

At least the theme typings is done at the moment. I have no experience in managing projects/branches at all, so feel free to start contributing by giving advice on how to organize this repo :)
